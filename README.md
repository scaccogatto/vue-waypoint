      // DOWN

});
</script>
```

## Props

### `active`

- [x] Can use a reactive variable
- [x] Can set `true`/`false` dinamically

Usage:

- Enable the waypoint: `<Waypoint :active="true" />`
- Disable the waypoint: `<Waypoint :active="false" />`

### `options`

- [x] Useful for inner div detection
- [x] Trigger `change` event a portion of the element is completely on screen
- [x] Is an [official IntersectionObserverInit implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver)

Usage:

- Set a custom `IntersectionObserver` options: `<Waypoint :options="options" />`
- Read what you can do with `options`: [IntersectionObserverInit docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver)

Options example:

```js
const options: IntersectionObserverInit = {
  root: document,
  rootMargin: '0px 0px 0px 0px',
  threshold: [0.25, 0.75]
};
```

### `tag`

- [x] Set your preferred tag for the element
- [x] Defaults to `div`

- Waypoint as div: `<Waypoint :tag="'div'" /> --> renders --> <div class="waypoint"></div>`
- Waypoint as span: `<Waypoint :tag="'span'" /> --> renders --> <span class="waypoint"></span>`
- Waypoint as p: `<Waypoint :tag="'p'" /> --> renders --> <p class="waypoint"></p>`

### `disableCssHelpers`

- [x] Disable automatic CSS classes on the Waypoint component
- [x] Defaults to `false`

Usage:

- Enable helpers (default): `<Waypoint :disableCssHelpers="false" />`
- Disable helpers: `<Waypoint :disableCssHelpers="true" />`

DOM result:

- With CSS helpers: `<Waypoint /> --> renders --> <div class="waypoint going-in direction-down"></div>`
- Without CSS helpers: `<Waypoint :disableCssHelpers="true" /> --> renders --> <div></div>`

## CSS helpers

- [x] Zero configuration needed
- [x] Useful for simple CSS animations

The component comes with three classes:

- `waypoint`: set when the waypoint is ready
- `going-in`, `going-out`: dinamically changed when the waypoint comes in and out
- `direction-up`, `direction-down`, `direction-left`, `direction-right`: dinamically changed when the direction changes

Examples:

- `<Waypoint class="waypoint going-in direction-up" />` - the element is visible and came from bottom and is going top (natural scroll)
- `<Waypoint class="waypoint going-in direction-down" />` - the element is visible and came from top and is going up (reverse natural scroll)
- `<Waypoint class="waypoint going-out direction-up" />` - the element is not visible and came from bottom and is going top
- `<Waypoint class="waypoint going-out direction-down" />` - the element is not visible and came from top and is going up

## Events

### `change`

Emitted every time the waypoint detects a change.

```html
<template>
  <Waypoint @change="onChange" />
</template>
```

```js
const changeFunction = (waypointState) => {..}
```

```js
WaypointState {
  el: Element,
  going: 'IN' | 'OUT';
  direction: 'UP' | 'DOWN' | 'LEFT' | 'RIGHT';
};
```
